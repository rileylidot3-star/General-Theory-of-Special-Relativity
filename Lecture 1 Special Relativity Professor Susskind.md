## Professor’s Introduction: Research Context and Motivation

## Large Hadron Collider (LHC)

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a circular particle accelerator that collides protons (and occasionally heavy ions) at extremely high center-of-mass energies to probe the fundamental structure of matter.

## Collision Energy

Collision energy is the total energy available in the center-of-mass frame of colliding particles, measured in electronvolts (eV). At the LHC, proton–proton collisions reach energies on the order of tera-electronvolts (TeV).

## Proton Structure

A proton is a composite particle composed of valence quarks (two up quarks and one down quark), gluons, and transient quark–antiquark pairs.

## Gluons

Gluons are massless gauge bosons that mediate the strong interaction and bind quarks inside hadrons.

## Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)

Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is the quantum field theory describing the strong interaction among quarks and gluons.

## Mass–Energy Equivalence

Mass–energy equivalence is the principle expressed by the relation , stating that mass is a form of energy.

## Elementary Particles

Elementary particles are particles with no known internal structure, including quarks, leptons, gauge bosons, and the Higgs boson.

## Higgs Field

The Higgs field is a scalar field that permeates all of spacetime and whose interaction with elementary particles gives rise to inertial mass.

## Higgs Boson

The Higgs boson is the quantum excitation of the Higgs field, experimentally discovered in 2012.

## Standard Model

The Standard Model is the theoretical framework describing electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions, excluding gravity.

## Open Questions in Fundamental Physics

Open questions include the nature of dark matter, matter–antimatter asymmetry, neutrino mass generation, gravity, and Higgs mass stability.

# Pure Definitions and Core Concepts

## Reference Frame

A reference frame is a coordinate system consisting of three spatial coordinates x, y, z and one time coordinate t, used to assign spacetime coordinates to physical events.

## Event

An event is a specific occurrence in spacetime, defined by a unique set of coordinates (x, y, z, t) in a given reference frame.

## Inertial Reference Frame

An inertial reference frame is a reference frame in which a free particle (one experiencing no net force) moves with constant velocity, and Newton’s first law holds.

## Principle of Relativity

The principle of relativity states that the laws of physics take the same mathematical form in all inertial reference frames.

## Speed of Light Postulate

The speed of light postulate states that light propagates in vacuum with a constant speed c, the same for all inertial observers, independent of the motion of the source or observer.

## Galilean Transformation

A Galilean transformation relates the coordinates of events between two inertial frames moving at constant relative velocity v:

 x' = x - vt
 t' = t

These transformations assume absolute time and fail to preserve the speed of light.

## Absolute Time (Classical Assumption)

Absolute time is the classical assumption that time flows identically for all observers and that simultaneity is universal and observer-independent.

## Simultaneity

Simultaneity refers to whether two spatially separated events occur at the same time within a given reference frame.

## Einstein Synchronization

Einstein synchronization is an operational procedure for synchronizing spatially separated clocks using light signals, assuming the speed of light is the same in all directions.

## Relativity of Simultaneity

The relativity of simultaneity is the principle that two events that are simultaneous in one inertial reference frame need not be simultaneous in another inertial reference frame moving relative to the first.

## Spacetime Diagram

A spacetime diagram is a graphical representation of events using space as one axis and time as another, with light rays represented as lines at 45° when units are chosen such that c = 1.

## Worldline

A worldline is the path traced by an object through spacetime, representing its spatial position as a function of time in a given reference frame.

## Natural Units

Natural units are units in which the speed of light is set equal to one, c = 1, allowing time and space to be measured in the same units.

## Practice Problems – Special Relativity Lecture 1

### Conceptual Problems

1. Define an event and explain why its coordinates depend on the reference frame used.

2. Explain why an observer inside a sealed train moving at constant velocity cannot determine the train’s speed using only mechanical experiments.

3. State the principle of relativity and explain how it applies to inertial reference frames.

4. Why does the Galilean transformation fail to preserve the speed of light?

5. Explain the meaning of the statement: “Simultaneity is frame-dependent.”

## Light and Reference Frames

6. A flash of light is emitted from the origin at t = 0. Write the equation describing its motion in a stationary frame.

7. Using a Galilean transformation, determine the apparent speed of this light pulse in a frame moving at velocity v. Why is this result physically unacceptable?

## Spacetime Diagrams

8. Sketch a spacetime diagram showing:

- A stationary observer

- A moving observer

- A light ray emitted from the origin

9. Explain why light rays appear at 45° angles in spacetime diagrams when c = 1.

## Simultaneity and Clocks

10. Describe the Einstein synchronization procedure and identify the key physical assumption involved.

11. Two clocks are synchronized in one inertial frame. Explain why an observer moving relative to that frame concludes the clocks are not synchronized.

## Short Answer / Reasoning

Which classical assumption must be abandoned to make the speed of light invariant across all inertial frames?

13. Explain why special relativity requires a new transformation between reference frames.

## Preview Problem

14. Suppose two events occur at the same position but at different times in one reference frame. Will all observers agree on the time ordering of these events? Briefly justify your answer.
